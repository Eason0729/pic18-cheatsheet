  "description": "Move a 4‑bit literal value into the **BSR** (Bank Select Register) bits 3:0.\n- The literal must be in the range 0x0–0xF.\n- Only the low four bits of BSR are affected; the upper bits remain unchanged.\n- This instruction is used to switch the active bank for file register accesses.",
  "examples": [
    "; Load BSR with 0x0 (bank 0)\nMOVLB 0x0 ; BSR<3:0> = 0x0",
    "; Load BSR with 0x5 (bank 5)\nMOVLB 0x5 ; BSR<3:0> = 0x5",
    "; Load BSR with 0xF (bank 15)\nMOVLB 0xF ; BSR<3:0> = 0xF",
    "; Example: switch to bank 2 before accessing a register\nMOVLB 0x2 ; switch to bank 2\nMOVF 0x10, W ; read from register 0x10 in bank 2"
