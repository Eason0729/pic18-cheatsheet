  "description": "Increment the contents of **f**. After incrementing, if the new value of **f** is **not zero** the following instruction is skipped. The instruction does not modify the carry flag, but updates the zero, negative and digit‑carry flags according to the new value of **f**.\n- `d = 0` → result is written to **WREG**.\n- `d = 1` → result is written back into register **f**.\n- `a = 0` → use access‑bank addressing.\n- `a = 1` → use banked addressing.",
