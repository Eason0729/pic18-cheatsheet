  "description": "Set bit **b** of file register **f** to 1.\n- `a = 0` → Access‑bank addressing. The register address is interpreted in the access bank.\n- `a = 1` → Banked addressing. The register address is interpreted in the current bank selected by **BSR**.\n- `b` is the bit number (0‑7) to be set.\n\nThe bit set operation does not modify any of the status bits other than the **C** bit, which is **cleared**.",
