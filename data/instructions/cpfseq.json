  "examples": [
    "; a=0 – compare register in access bank, skip if equal\nCPFSEQ 0x20, 0 ; skips next if W = 0x20",
    "; a=1 – compare register in banked address, skip if equal\nCPFSEQ 0x62, 1 ; skips next if W = value at 0x62 in banked area",
    "; Load literal into WREG then compare access bank\nMOVLW 0x20\nCPFSEQ 0x20, 0 ; skips next if W = 0x20 (equal)",
    "; Load literal into WREG then compare banked address\nMOVLW 0x20\nCPFSEQ 0x62, 1 ; skips next if W = 0x20 (equal)",
