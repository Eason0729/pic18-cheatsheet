If **WREG** contains a value greater than that in **f**, the instruction immediately following the compare instruction is skipped. The instruction also updates the Status register: Z is set when the values are equal and C is set when **WREG** > f.\n- `a = 0` → Access‑bank addressing.\n- `a = 1` → Banked addressing.",
